        Hi, I'm a Front-end Developer based in Lindau, Germany. I started
        programming as I was searching for a new challenge in my life. The thing
        I like the most about programming is that you see what you make. Only a
        short line of code can change the appearance of the whole website.

        <span
          >Quickly I realized that I really enjoy it, so I decided to seek a
          professional software development school. I joined the Developer
          Akademy a short time after that. There I've completed a lot of
          different projects, both individually and in groups.
